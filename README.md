# Oregon-trail
Luis Delatorre 

This is a game of adventure. It is based on the original Oregon Trail game. It is a decision tree game that is text based. There will be different options for players to type in, and depending on the decision they do, there will be different outcomes. The setting is placed in any year the player would like, but still have the same options as the game. You will need to travel 2000 miles, and will have to hunt, rest, and carry on the trail in order to survive. Some twists and turns will occur during the game, but overall it should be a game that everyone is able to survive and enjoy.
